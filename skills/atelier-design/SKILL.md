# Atelier — Design Skill

A personal, curated collection of design engineering knowledge. The parent skill holds shared principles and references; sub-skills (atelier-design-layout, atelier-design-interaction, atelier-design-copy) handle specific concerns.

## Design System Protocol

**Before suggesting any value — spacing, color, type size, radius, shadow — check for existing tokens, CSS variables, or component conventions in the codebase.**

Scan for:
- CSS custom properties (`--color-*`, `--space-*`, `--text-*`, `--radius-*`)
- Tailwind config (`tailwind.config.js/ts`) for custom tokens
- Design token files (`tokens.json`, `theme.ts`, etc.)
- Existing component patterns (how are buttons, cards, inputs already built?)

**Rule: propose adjustments using the existing system. Never override — suggest.** If a token exists for something, use it. If a value doesn't exist in the system, note the gap and propose adding it to the design system rather than hardcoding.

This applies to all modes: atelier-design-layout, atelier-design-interaction, atelier-design-copy.

## Context Gathering Protocol

Design skills produce generic output without project context. Before doing any design work, confirm you have this minimum:

- **Target audience**: Who uses this product, in what context?
- **Use cases**: What jobs are they trying to get done?
- **Brand personality / tone**: How should the interface feel?

**Gathering order:**
1. Check current instructions for a **Design Context** section — if present, proceed.
2. Check `.atelier.md` at the project root — if present and sufficient, proceed.
3. Otherwise ask the user directly for the three items above. Do **not** infer from the codebase — code tells you what was built, not who it's for.

## Modes (Sub-Skills)

Each mode is invokable on its own. Use this table to decide which to load.

| Mode | When to use | Read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **atelier-design-layout** | Alignment, sizing, spacing, visual hierarchy, rhythm, harmony | `../atelier-design-layout/SKILL.md` |
| **atelier-design-interaction** | Animation, hover/press states, micro-interactions, delight, feel | `../atelier-design-interaction/SKILL.md` |
| **atelier-design-copy** | Microcopy, labels, error messages, tone, clarity | `../atelier-design-copy/SKILL.md` |

When the user describes a concern that maps cleanly to one mode, invoke that mode. If it spans multiple (e.g. "polish this page"), run them in order: **atelier-design-layout → atelier-design-interaction → atelier-design-copy**.

## Shared References

Loaded on demand — do not read proactively. Consult when a mode instructs you to, or when the current task requires depth on that topic.

| Topic | File | When to read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Typography | `references/typography.md` | Font choice, hierarchy, sizing, OpenType features |
| Color | `references/color.md` | Color systems, contrast, dark mode, accessibility |
| Spacing & layout | `references/spacing-layout.md` | Grids, rhythm, concentric radius, optical alignment |
| Motion | `references/motion.md` | Easing, duration, staggering, interruptibility |
| Interaction | `references/interaction.md` | Hit areas, feedback, press states, hover |
| Accessibility | `references/accessibility.md` | Contrast, focus, keyboard, screen readers |
| Anti-patterns | `references/anti-patterns.md` | "AI slop" tells, generic aesthetics to avoid |
| Craft | `references/craft.md` | Taste philosophy, why details compound |

## Shared Libraries

Structured data — consult when you need concrete values.

| Library | File |
| --- | --- |
| Color palettes | `libraries/palettes.json` |
| Font pairings | `libraries/font-pairings.json` |
| Easing curves | `libraries/easing-curves.json` |

---

## Core Principles

These apply across every mode. Keep them in mind whether you are composing a layout, tuning an interaction, or writing copy.

1. **Taste is trained, not innate.** Study why the best interfaces feel the way they do. Reverse engineer. Be curious.
2. **Unseen details compound.** Most details users never consciously notice — that is the point. Aggregate invisible correctness is what people feel.
3. **Beauty is leverage.** In a world of good-enough software, craft is the differentiator.
4. **Intent over intensity.** Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work. What fails is the middle — the timid, generic default.
5. **Reversibility.** Prefer reversible changes. A subtle refinement that works beats a bold swing that misses.

## Review Output Format

When reviewing UI code, always present findings as a markdown table with `Before | After | Why` columns. One row per change. Group tables by principle with a heading above each. Never list findings as separate `Before:` / `After:` lines outside a table.

### Example

#### Concentric border radius
| Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rounded-xl` on card + `rounded-xl` on inner button (`p-2`) | `rounded-2xl` on card, `rounded-lg` on inner button | Outer radius = inner radius + padding. Mismatched radii on nested elements is the most common thing that makes interfaces feel off. |

If a principle was reviewed and nothing needed to change, omit the table. Empty tables add noise.

## Meta

- **Version**: see frontmatter. Bump on any absorption or substantive change. Log in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Evolution**: this skill grows by absorbing techniques from upstream skills. Never copy blindly — run the eval corpus first, then cherry-pick into the relevant reference file, then log in CHANGELOG with attribution.

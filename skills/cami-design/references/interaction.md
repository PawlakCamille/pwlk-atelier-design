# Interaction

Deep reference for interactive states and feedback. Loaded on demand.

## Press Feedback

- `scale(0.96)` on `:active` is the sweet spot for buttons.
- **Never** below `0.95` — feels exaggerated, like a cartoon.
- Pair with `transition: scale 100ms ease-out` for the release.
- Add a `static` prop to disable when motion would distract.

## Hover States

- Subtle. Hover is not a celebration — it's a confirmation that an element is interactive.
- Common patterns: background shift (~5-10% lightness), subtle shadow lift, color deepen.
- Avoid: scaling on hover (feels unstable), color shifts > 15% (too dramatic).
- **Hover flicker fix:** when a hover state triggers an animation on the element itself, the cursor can leave the animated area mid-transition and re-trigger the exit — causing flicker. Apply hover on the parent, animate a child inside it:
  ```css
  /* ✗ — cursor leaving the scaled element re-triggers :hover off */
  .btn:hover { transform: scale(1.02); }

  /* ✓ — hover zone stays fixed, inner element animates */
  .btn:hover .btn-inner { transform: scale(1.02); }
  ```
- **Gate hover animations behind a media query** — touch devices trigger hover on tap, causing false positives:
  ```css
  @media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
    .element:hover { transform: scale(1.02); }
  }
  ```

## Focus States

- Visible, always. Never `outline: none` without a replacement.
- Match the brand but stay distinct from hover.
- Use `:focus-visible` to show rings only on keyboard nav, not mouse clicks.

## Hit Areas

- Minimum 40×40px regardless of visible size.
- Extend via pseudo-element:
  ```css
  position: relative;
  &::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    inset: -8px; /* expands hit area */
  }
  ```
- Never overlap hit areas of adjacent interactive elements.

## Loading States

- Skeletons > spinners for content that has known structure.
- Spinner only when the action is instant-feeling (< 1s) and you just need to reassure.
- Optimistic UI when safe — update immediately, roll back on error with a clear message.
- **Disable the button while loading** to prevent double-submission — re-enable on success or error.
- **Minimum visible duration.** Add a show-delay (~150–300ms) before a skeleton or spinner renders, and a minimum visible time (~300–500ms) once it does. Prevents flicker on fast responses — a spinner that flashes for 80ms looks like a bug. React's `<Suspense>` can handle this natively.

## Disabled States

- Reduce opacity to ~50%.
- Remove hover/press affordances — don't tease interactivity that isn't there.
- If possible, explain **why** it's disabled (tooltip or inline hint). Never leave the user guessing.

## Blur Trick

When a crossfade between two states feels off despite trying different easings and durations, add subtle `filter: blur(2px)` during the transition. Without blur, you see two distinct objects overlapping — blur bridges the visual gap by blending them into a single perceived transformation.

```css
.button-content {
  transition: filter 200ms ease, opacity 200ms ease;
}
.button-content.transitioning {
  filter: blur(2px);
  opacity: 0.7;
}
```

Keep blur under 20px. Heavy blur is expensive, especially in Safari.

## Tooltip Behaviour

- First tooltip: delay before appearing (prevents accidental activation on cursor pass)
- Subsequent tooltips (hovering adjacent elements while one is open): **instant, no animation**

```css
.tooltip { transition: transform 125ms ease-out, opacity 125ms ease-out; }
.tooltip[data-instant] { transition-duration: 0ms; }
```

This makes toolbars and nav feel significantly faster without removing the protective delay.

## Toggle & Selection States

- Toggle switches: smooth slide + color transition (200–300ms)
- Checkbox: scale pulse on check (brief `scale(1.1)` → `scale(1)`) with opacity fade
- On mobile: haptic feedback on toggle/selection change

## Drag & Drop

- **Lift effect on drag start**: `scale(1.02)` + shadow increase — signals the element is "picked up"
- **Drop zone highlight**: subtle background or border change when dragging over a valid target
- **Snap on drop**: brief spring animation settling into final position
- **Undo escape hatch**: toast with undo action if the user drops in the wrong place

## Haptics (mobile/native)

- Light tap on primary action success
- Selection change on toggle / picker
- Warning on destructive confirm
- Don't haptic-spam — frequent haptics become noise fast

## Keyboard

- Every interactive element reachable via Tab.
- Standard shortcuts respected (Enter to submit, Esc to close, Arrow keys in lists).
- Focus trap inside modals; restore focus to trigger on close.

## Mobile & Touch

- **`touch-action: manipulation`** on interactive elements — eliminates the 300ms double-tap-zoom delay that makes buttons feel sluggish on mobile Safari.
  ```css
  button, a { touch-action: manipulation; }
  ```
- **`-webkit-tap-highlight-color`** — default is translucent gray that flashes on tap. Either disable it or tint to the accent for branded feedback.
  ```css
  html { -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; }
  ```
- **`overscroll-behavior: contain`** on modals, drawers, sheets, scrollable dropdowns — prevents scroll chaining where scrolling inside the component scrolls the page behind it.
- **Drag interactions:** disable text selection during drag, apply `inert` to the dragged element so selection and hover don't fire simultaneously.
  ```css
  .dragging { user-select: none; }
  ```
- **`autoFocus` sparingly** — desktop only, on a single primary input (login email, search on a search page). Never on mobile — the keyboard opening causes layout shift and disorients the user.

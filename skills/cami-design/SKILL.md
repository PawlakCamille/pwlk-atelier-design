# Cami — Design Skill

A personal, curated collection of design engineering knowledge. The parent skill holds shared principles and references; sub-skills (cami-design-layout, cami-design-interaction, cami-design-copy) handle specific concerns.

## Design System Protocol

**Before suggesting any value — spacing, color, type size, radius, shadow — check for existing tokens, CSS variables, or component conventions in the codebase.**

Scan for:
- CSS custom properties (`--color-*`, `--space-*`, `--text-*`, `--radius-*`)
- Tailwind config (`tailwind.config.js/ts`) for custom tokens
- Design token files (`tokens.json`, `theme.ts`, etc.)
- Existing component patterns (how are buttons, cards, inputs already built?)

**Rule: propose adjustments using the existing system. Never override — suggest.** If a token exists for something, use it. If a value doesn't exist in the system, note the gap and propose adding it to the design system rather than hardcoding.

This applies to all modes: cami-design-layout, cami-design-interaction, cami-design-copy.

## Context Gathering Protocol

Design skills produce generic output without project context. Before doing any design work, confirm you have this minimum:

- **Target audience**: Who uses this product, in what context?
- **Use cases**: What jobs are they trying to get done?
- **Brand personality / tone**: How should the interface feel?

**Gathering order:**
1. Check current instructions for a **Design Context** section — if present, proceed.
2. Check `.cami.md` at the project root — if present and sufficient, proceed.
3. Otherwise ask the user directly for the three items above. Do **not** infer from the codebase — code tells you what was built, not who it's for.

## Modes (Sub-Skills)

Each mode is invokable on its own. Use this table to decide which to load.

| Mode | When to use | Read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **cami-design-layout** | Alignment, sizing, spacing, visual hierarchy, rhythm, harmony | `../cami-design-layout/SKILL.md` |
| **cami-design-interaction** | Animation, hover/press states, micro-interactions, delight, feel | `../cami-design-interaction/SKILL.md` |
| **cami-design-copy** | Microcopy, labels, error messages, tone, clarity | `../cami-design-copy/SKILL.md` |

When the user describes a concern that maps cleanly to one mode, invoke that mode. If it spans multiple (e.g. "polish this page"), run them in order: **cami-design-layout → cami-design-interaction → cami-design-copy**.

## Shared References

Loaded on demand — do not read proactively. Consult when a mode instructs you to, or when the current task requires depth on that topic.

| Topic | File | When to read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Typography | `references/typography.md` | Font choice, hierarchy, sizing, OpenType features, typographic characters |
| Color | `references/color.md` | Color systems, contrast, dark mode, native browser UI |
| Spacing & layout | `references/spacing-layout.md` | Grids, rhythm, concentric radius, safe areas, content resilience |
| Motion | `references/motion.md` | Easing, duration, staggering, interruptibility |
| Interaction | `references/interaction.md` | Hit areas, feedback, press states, hover, mobile/touch |
| Forms | `references/forms.md` | Input attributes, submit behavior, error placement, placeholders — load when the review target contains form controls |
| Accessibility | `references/accessibility.md` | Contrast, focus, keyboard, screen readers |
| Anti-patterns | `references/anti-patterns.md` | "AI slop" tells, generic aesthetics to avoid |
| Craft | `references/craft.md` | Taste philosophy, why details compound |

## Shared Libraries

Structured data — consult when you need concrete values.

| Library | File |
| --- | --- |
| Color palettes | `libraries/palettes.json` |
| Font pairings | `libraries/font-pairings.json` |
| Easing curves | `libraries/easing-curves.json` |

## Core Principles

These apply across every mode. Keep them in mind whether you are composing a layout, tuning an interaction, or writing copy.

1. **Taste is trained, not innate.** Study why the best interfaces feel the way they do. Reverse engineer. Be curious.
2. **Unseen details compound.** Most details users never consciously notice — that is the point. Aggregate invisible correctness is what people feel.
3. **Beauty is leverage.** In a world of good-enough software, craft is the differentiator.
4. **Intent over intensity.** Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work. What fails is the middle — the timid, generic default.
5. **Reversibility.** Prefer reversible changes. A subtle refinement that works beats a bold swing that misses.

## Review Output Format

Present findings grouped into lettered sections. Each section clusters related issues under a descriptive title. One row per change, numbered within its section.

### Structure

```
## A — [title describing what was found]
| # | Before | After | Why |
|---|--------|-------|-----|
| A1 | ... | ... | ... |
| A2 | ... | ... | ... |

## B — [title describing what was found]
| # | Before | After | Why |
|---|--------|-------|-----|
| B1 | ... | ... | ... |
```

### Section titles

The letter is fixed (A, B, C…) for addressing. The title is generated from what you actually found — never a generic category label.

- ✓ `## A — Concentric radius drift`
- ✓ `## B — Missing hover and focus states`
- ✓ `## C — Vague confirmation copy`
- ✗ `## A — Layout & rhythm` — too generic, tells the user nothing

Use only sections that have findings. Omit empty sections entirely.

### Closing line

End every review with:

> Your call on which to take. If it's easier to go through them together, say the word.

### Walkthrough mode

If the user wants to decide interactively — going through items individually, wanting help deciding, or asking to take it one at a time — use `AskUserQuestion` per item. Detect intent, not keywords.

Options per item: **Apply** / **Decline** / **Discuss** / **Stop**

- `Discuss` = user pushes back or proposes a variant; respond, then re-ask the same item.
- Before starting a new section, if its items are closely related, offer `Apply all in [section]` as a single question first — don't force row-by-row when a batch is obvious.
- On `Stop`, summarize what was applied, declined, and what's still open. Example: `Done: A1 and A2. Declined A3. Stopped with B1–B4 still open.`

### Inline code

If an item requires a code snippet, include it inside the After cell. Never break out of the table format to show code separately.

## Meta

- **Version**: see frontmatter. Bump on any absorption or substantive change. Log in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Evolution**: this skill grows by absorbing techniques from upstream skills. Never copy blindly — run the eval corpus first, then cherry-pick into the relevant reference file, then log in CHANGELOG with attribution.

### jakubkrehel/make-interfaces-feel-better
Author: Jakub Krehel

Contributions absorbed:
- Concentric border radius rule (outer = inner + padding)
- Tabular numbers for dynamic values
- `scale(0.96)` press feedback — never below `0.95`

- `initial={false}` on `AnimatePresence` for page-load prevention
- Minimum 40×40px hit areas

### zenobi-us/dotfiles — basic-design-principles
Author: zenobi-us

Contributions absorbed:
- Elevation consistency rule ("pick one elevation treatment per hierarchy level — don't mix a shadow-recipe card with a flat-border card in the same list")

## Web platform references

Modern CSS primitives added via progressive-enhancement guidance drawn from MDN and Chrome/Safari/WebKit release notes:
- `scrollbar-gutter: stable` — prevent content shift when scrollbars appear (`references/spacing-layout.md`)
- `interpolate-size: allow-keywords` + `calc-size()` — animate `height`/`width` to/from `auto` (`references/motion.md`)
- `::selection` + relative color syntax (`oklch(from …)`) — branded selection tint (`references/color.md`)

### Anthropic — Claude Code Review docs
Source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/code-review

Contributions absorbed (May 2026, into `cami-design-engineer`):
- 3-tier severity model: 🔴 Important / 🟡 Nit / 🟣 Pre-existing
- Verification bar — every finding cites `file:line` from real code, no inference from naming
- Re-review convergence — second pass over the same code suppresses new nits, posts Important findings only
- Skip rules: anything CI already enforces, generated files, lockfiles, vendored deps, intentional test-only violations
- Summary shape — open with a one-line tally (`X 🔴 · Y 🟡 · Z 🟣`); lead with `No blocking issues for handoff` when nothing is Important

### vercel-labs/agent-skills — composition-patterns
Source: https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/composition-patterns

Contributions absorbed (May 2026, into `cami-design-engineer` → Component Composition):
- `architecture-avoid-boolean-props` — boolean prop sprawl refactor to `variant` prop or compound parts
- `architecture-compound-components` — slot-shaped UI uses the compound pattern
- `patterns-explicit-variants` — explicit variants over boolean modes
- `patterns-children-over-render-props` — children over `renderX` callbacks
- `react19-no-forwardref` — drop `forwardRef` in React 19+
- `state-decouple-implementation`, `state-context-interface`, `state-lift-state` — provider exposes a stable `{ state, actions }` interface; lift state to share across siblings; children never reach into the storage

### vercel-labs/agent-skills — react-best-practices
Source: https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/react-best-practices

Contributions absorbed (May 2026, into `cami-design-engineer` → State & Data Flow + Performance & Rendering):
- Re-render: `rerender-defer-reads`, `rerender-memo`, `rerender-dependencies`, `rerender-derived-state`, `rerender-functional-setstate`, `rerender-lazy-state-init`, `rerender-transitions`
- Rendering: `rendering-animate-svg-wrapper`, `rendering-hoist-jsx`, `rendering-conditional-render`
- Bundle: `bundle-barrel-imports`, `bundle-dynamic-imports`
- Async / data: `async-parallel`, `client-swr-dedup`, `client-event-listeners`
- JS perf: `js-tosorted-immutable`, `js-set-map-lookups`

Deliberately **not** absorbed: all `server-*` and Next-specific async rules (we target Vite SPAs, not Next), micro-opts (`js-cache-*`, `js-combine-iterations`, `js-length-check-first`, `js-early-exit`, `js-hoist-regexp`, `js-min-max-loop`, `js-batch-dom-css`), niche rendering (`rendering-content-visibility`, `rendering-svg-precision`, `rendering-hydration-no-flicker`, `rendering-activity`), advanced ref tricks (`advanced-event-handler-refs`, `advanced-use-latest`), `bundle-conditional`, `bundle-preload`, `bundle-defer-third-party`. 17 of 45 rules absorbed; the rest don't apply to the target stack.

### wshobson/agents — code-review-excellence
Source: https://github.com/wshobson/agents

Contributions absorbed (May 2026, into `cami-design-engineer`):
- PR size guard — ask the user to scope by feature or file when the diff exceeds ~400 changed lines
- Mutating props anti-pattern — treat props as read-only; notify the parent via callback rather than mutating

License: see upstream.

### mistyhx/frontend-design-audit
Source: https://github.com/mistyhx/frontend-design-audit

Contributions absorbed (May 2026):
- Severity calibration framework — Frequency × Impact × Persistence (now in parent `Review Output Format → Severity scale`)
- Verify pass — focused second look at modified code/UI after fixes are applied (now in parent `Review Output Format → Walkthrough mode`)

### Internal CI code-review workflow
A private continuous-integration code-review prompt, maintained by the author.

Contributions absorbed (May 2026, into `cami-design-engineer`):
- Untested business logic flagging — flag hooks/utilities/services with branching logic that lack tests, naming the function and branches that need coverage (don't write the tests; surface the gap for the tech team)
- E2E testid awareness — grep `e2e/` for `data-testid` selectors before flagging refactors that remove or rename them; testid changes break E2E silently

The workflow itself is internal; only its review philosophy informed the engineer skill.

### vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines
Author: Vercel Labs

Contributions absorbed (Apr 2026):
- New `references/forms.md` — input attributes, labels, submit behavior, errors, placeholders, unsaved-changes warnings
- Mobile & Touch section in `references/interaction.md` — `touch-action`, `-webkit-tap-highlight-color`, `overscroll-behavior: contain`, drag patterns, `autoFocus` rules
- Loading minimum-duration rule in `references/interaction.md` (show-delay + min visible time)
- Typographic characters section in `references/typography.md` — `…` vs `...`, curly quotes, `&nbsp;` for glued terms
- `preconnect` guidance for font/asset CDNs in `references/typography.md`
- Native Browser UI section in `references/color.md` — `color-scheme`, `<meta name="theme-color">`, Windows `<select>` bg/color fix
- Safe Areas (mobile notch) section in `references/spacing-layout.md` — `env(safe-area-inset-*)`
- Content Resilience section in `references/spacing-layout.md` — `truncate`, `line-clamp-*`, `break-words`, the `min-w-0` flex gotcha
- Anchored Headings section in `references/spacing-layout.md` — `scroll-margin-top` under sticky headers
- SVG Safari fix in `references/motion.md` — `transform-box: fill-box` on `<g>` wrapper

Deliberately **not** absorbed: URL-as-state, deep-linking, hydration rules, i18n/locale formatting, image/CLS rules (engineering scope), Title Case heading rule (conflicts with cami-design-copy's sentence-case default), forms sub-skill (too heavy — chose reference-only).

## Optional external dependencies

These are skills `cami-design` *can* defer to when they're installed. They are not bundled and not required — sub-skills must skip silently if the dependency is missing.

- **`humanizer` skill** — referenced from `cami-design-copy/SKILL.md`. Strips AI-tell patterns from user-facing copy (synthetic phrasing, sycophancy, padding). Not bundled here. If you maintain a `humanizer` skill you'd like cami-design to integrate with, open an issue; otherwise the soft reference is a no-op when the skill isn't installed.

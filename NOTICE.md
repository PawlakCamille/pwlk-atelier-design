### jakubkrehel/make-interfaces-feel-better
Author: Jakub Krehel

Contributions absorbed:
- Concentric border radius rule (outer = inner + padding)
- Tabular numbers for dynamic values
- `scale(0.96)` press feedback — never below `0.95`
- Image outline rule (pure black/white at 0.1 opacity, never tinted)
- Split-and-stagger enter animation pattern
- `initial={false}` on `AnimatePresence` for page-load prevention
- Minimum 40×40px hit areas

### zenobi-us/dotfiles — basic-design-principles
Author: zenobi-us

Contributions absorbed:
- Elevation consistency rule ("pick one elevation treatment per hierarchy level — don't mix a shadow-recipe card with a flat-border card in the same list")

## Web platform references

Modern CSS primitives added via progressive-enhancement guidance drawn from MDN and Chrome/Safari/WebKit release notes:
- `scrollbar-gutter: stable` — prevent content shift when scrollbars appear (`references/spacing-layout.md`)
- `interpolate-size: allow-keywords` + `calc-size()` — animate `height`/`width` to/from `auto` (`references/motion.md`)
- `::selection` + relative color syntax (`oklch(from …)`) — branded selection tint (`references/color.md`)

Sources: developer.mozilla.org, developer.chrome.com, webkit.org.

### vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines
Author: Vercel Labs

Contributions absorbed (Apr 2026):
- New `references/forms.md` — input attributes, labels, submit behavior, errors, placeholders, unsaved-changes warnings
- Mobile & Touch section in `references/interaction.md` — `touch-action`, `-webkit-tap-highlight-color`, `overscroll-behavior: contain`, drag patterns, `autoFocus` rules
- Loading minimum-duration rule in `references/interaction.md` (show-delay + min visible time)
- Typographic characters section in `references/typography.md` — `…` vs `...`, curly quotes, `&nbsp;` for glued terms
- `preconnect` guidance for font/asset CDNs in `references/typography.md`
- Native Browser UI section in `references/color.md` — `color-scheme`, `<meta name="theme-color">`, Windows `<select>` bg/color fix
- Safe Areas (mobile notch) section in `references/spacing-layout.md` — `env(safe-area-inset-*)`
- Content Resilience section in `references/spacing-layout.md` — `truncate`, `line-clamp-*`, `break-words`, the `min-w-0` flex gotcha
- Anchored Headings section in `references/spacing-layout.md` — `scroll-margin-top` under sticky headers
- SVG Safari fix in `references/motion.md` — `transform-box: fill-box` on `<g>` wrapper

Deliberately **not** absorbed: URL-as-state, deep-linking, hydration rules, i18n/locale formatting, image/CLS rules (engineering scope), Title Case heading rule (conflicts with cami-design-copy's sentence-case default), forms sub-skill (too heavy — chose reference-only).
